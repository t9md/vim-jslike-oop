vim-jslike-oop
====================

This is experiment to explore Vim's capability to support OOP style programming.
It's just experiment.
Currently, I am not intending to be useful for real problem.

Semantics is not consistent in several methods.
There is several attempt to mimic OOP in VimScript.
One of the biggest example are [tlib](http://www.vim.org/sources.php).
