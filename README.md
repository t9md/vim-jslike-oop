vim-jslike-oop
====================

This is experiment to explore Vim's capability to support OOP style programming.  
It's just experiment.  
Currently, I am not intending to be useful for real problem.  

Semantics is not consistent in several methods.  
There are several attempt to mimic OOP in VimScript.  
One of the biggest example are [tlib](http://github.com/tomtom/tlib_vim).
